#orderApp

I have made a basic AngularJS applicaiton that displays services provided by a company and their proces while dynamically changing the total value of services as they are clicked and made active or inactive.

#searchApp

This AngularJS app is a sample of an in-site keyword-based search, which filters the input string as you type it and returns the results with an image link and title.
